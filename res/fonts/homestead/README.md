# Homestead 

Designed by [Luke Lisi](http://lisidesign.com)
Distributed by [The Lost Type Co-op](http://losttype.com/)

## Terms & Conditions June 2016

All fonts downloaded from [LisiDesign.com](http://lisidesign.com) are independently distributed and designed by Luke Lisi. 
They are available to use for personal and commercial use alike unless otherwise noted. For more detailed 
licensing information, please review the contents of the "License.pdf", which will be provided with the 
respective font download, below.

All fonts are available in OpenType format (.OTF), however, Mr. Lisi also includes TrueType (.TTF) formats with the downloaded files. 
Prefer OpenType over TrueType because OpenType provides more robust features including alternate glyphs as well as more
advanced metrics tables.

Luke is always interested in improving the fonts so if you have any feedback or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact 
Luke at luke@lisidesign.com.

Your support is greatly appreciated and any and all contributions help in the future development of fonts.
Thank you for your interest and support. Enjoy!
